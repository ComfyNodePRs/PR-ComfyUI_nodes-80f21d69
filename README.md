# ComfyUI Nodes

Some custom nodes for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).

- `SaveString`: Writes a string to a text or json file in the output directory. For json output, string is parsed and pretty printed.
- `TokenizerVocab`: Converts the tokenizer vocabulary to a json string (limited to SDXL clips atm).
